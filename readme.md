### TODO:
- [ ] Implement packed padded sequence for LSTM
- [ ] Implement save interval features
- [ ] Reduce saving, don't save 6 times per epoch...
- [ ] Maybe try lowering the minlen for segments?
- [x] Try starting from lower learning rate for pre-trained models? Or have higher decay? % didn't work
- [?] Try doing a MIL experiment on short segments only, to make training faster
- [x] Try running median filters with size 1
- [x] Add an ablation study with BCE
- [ ] Contextual information?
